# Get Started

Uncovr is a modular backend framework for building type-safe REST APIs in Rust.

## What is Uncovr?

Uncovr helps you build REST APIs with:

- **Minimal boilerplate** - Focus on business logic
- **Type safety** - Compile-time validation of requests and responses
- **Auto-generated docs** - OpenAPI documentation from your types
- **Microbackend architecture** - Self-contained, testable endpoint modules

Built on Axum and Tokio for high performance.
